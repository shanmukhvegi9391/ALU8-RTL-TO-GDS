This repository contains the complete flow of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed in Verilog and implemented from RTL → GDSII using the OpenLANE open-source physical design toolchain on the SkyWater SKY130 PDK.

The project covers digital design, verification, synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, DRC/LVS, and final GDSII generation — exactly how a real ASIC design is done.

Project Overview:

The goal is to design an 8-bit ALU that supports essential arithmetic and logical operations and then convert the RTL into a manufacturable layout (GDSII).

Arithmetic:
Addition
Subtraction
Increment
Decrement

Logical:
AND, OR, XOR, NOT
